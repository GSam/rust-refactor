\begin{abstract}
Rust is a novel programming language developed by Mozilla to replace C as the implementation choice for its entire codebase. Rust supports novel constructs such as lifetimes, ownership, controlled garbage collection, macros and a large number of systems programming features while maintaining the performance requirements of a modern browser.

We describe a new refactoring tool that helps developers using Rust including discussing the issues and unusual decisions encountered due to the complexities of modern systems languages. We outline the lessons learned and hope our paper will help inform future programming languages design and enable refactoring to be integrated into the IDE's. The resulting refactoring tool is written in Rust and available from Github under an MIT license \cite{rrproject}.
