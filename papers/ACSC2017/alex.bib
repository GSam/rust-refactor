                  software architecture team,
                  collectivelyâmust strike a delicate balance
                  between an external focusâboth outwards:
                  Listening to customers, users, watching technology,
                  developing a long-term vision, and inwards: driving
                  the development teamsâand an internal,
                  reflective focus: spending time to make the right
                  design choices, validating them, and documenting
                  them. Teams that stray too far away from this
                  metastable equilibrium fall into some traps that we
                  describe as antipatterns of software architecture
                  teams. "

  abstract =	 "Object immutability is a familiar concept that
                  allows safe sharing of objects. Existing language
                  support for immutability is based on immutable
                  classes. However, class-based approaches are
                  restrictive because programmers can neither make
                  instances of arbitrary classes immutable, nor can
                  they control when an instance becomes
                  immutable. These restrictions prevent many
                  interesting applications where objects of mutable
                  classes go through a number of modifications before
                  they become immutable.  \par This paper presents a
                  flexible technique to enforce the immutability of
                  individual objects by transferring their ownership
                  to a special freezer object, which prevents further
                  modification. The paper demonstrates how
                  immutability facilitates program verification by
                  extending the Boogie methodology for object
                  invariants to immutable objects. The technique is
                  based on Spec Sharp dynamic ownership, but the
                  concepts also apply to other ownership systems that
                  support transfer."

                  should follow the potential capabilities of

                  programming paradigm offering novel ways to develop
                  software. Functional logic programming supports
                  specification, prototyping, and application
                  programming within a single language. It is the
                  basis of practical and convenient approach to
                  produce high-quality software. Functional logic
                  programming is terse yet clear, supporting rapid
                  development by avoiding some tedious tasks, and
                  allows incremental refinements to improve
                  efficiency. It makes programming fun without
                  sacrificing reliability. }

@InProceedings{artzi:2006:test-inputs,
  Abstract =	 {A test input for an object-oriented program
                  typically consists of a sequence of method calls
                  that use the API defined by the program under
                  test. Generating legal test inputs can be
                  challenging because, for some programs, the set of
                  legal method sequences is much smaller than the set
                  of all possible sequences; without a formal
                  specification of legal sequences, an input generator
                  is bound to produce mostly illegal sequences.  \par
                  We propose a scalable technique that combines
                  dynamic analysis with random testing to help an
                  input generator create legal test inputs without a
                  formal specification, even for programs in which
                  most sequences are illegal. The technique uses an
                  example execution of the program to infer a model of
                  legal call sequences, and uses the model to guide a
                  random input generator towards legal but
                  behaviorally-diverse sequences.  \par We have
                  implemented our technique for Java, in a tool called
                  Palulu, and evaluated its effectiveness in creating
                  legal inputs for real programs. Our experimental
                  results indicate that the technique is effective and
                  scalable. Our preliminary evaluation indicates that
                  the technique can quickly generate legal sequences
                  for complex inputs: in a case study, Palulu created
                  legal test inputs in seconds for a set of complex
                  classes, for which it took an expert thirty minutes
                  to generate a single legal input.},

  Abstract =	 {This paper describes a type system that is capable
                  of expressing and enforcing immutability
                  constraints.  The specific constraint expressed is
                  that the abstract state of the object to which an
                  immutable reference refers cannot be modified using
                  that reference.  The abstract state is (part of) the
                  transitively reachable state: that is, the state of
                  the object and all state reachable from it by
                  following references.  The type system permits
                  explicitly excluding fields or objects from the
                  abstract state of an object.  For a statically
                  type-safe language, the type system guarantees
                  reference immutability.  If the language is extended
                  with immutability downcasts, then run-time checks
                  enforce the reference immutability constraints.
                  \par In order to better understand the usability and
                  efficacy of the type system, we have implemented an
                  extension to Java, called Javari, that includes all
                  the features of our type system.  Javari is
                  interoperable with Java and existing JVMs.  It can
                  be viewed as a proposal for the semantics of the
                  Java \texttt{const} keyword, though Javari's syntax
                  uses \texttt{readonly} instead.  This paper
                  describes the design and implementation of Javari,
                  including the type-checking rules for the language.
                  This paper also discusses experience with 160,000
                  lines of Javari code.  Javari was easy to use and
                  provided a number of benefits, including detecting
                  errors in well-tested code.},

                  have precisely one primary owner, organising the
                  heap into an ownership tree. Unfortunately, a tree
                  structure is too restrictive for many programs, and
                  prevents many common design patterns where multiple
                  objects interact. Multiple Ownership is an ownership
                  type system where objects can have more than one
                  owner, and the resulting ownership structure forms a
                  DAG. We give a straightforward model for multiple
                  ownership, focusing in particular on how multiple
                  ownership can support a powerful effect system that
                  determines when two computations interfere - in
                  spite of the DAG structure. We present a core
                  programming language MOJO, Multiple Ownership for
                  Java-like Objects, including a type and effects
                  system, and soundness proof. In comparison to other
                  systems, MOJO imposes absolutely no restrictions on
                  pointers, modifications or programs' structure, but
                  in spite of this, MOJO's effects can be used to
                  reason about or describe programs' behaviour. }

                  analysis. The optimizer is tested on real-world
                  applications such as itself and JavaSoft's Java
                  compiler. Results show that the optimizations
                  benefit well from the side-effect analysis. The best
                  side-effect analysis gives five to ten times as many
                  optimizations as without an analysis, and, in one

                  impact of a type of side effect (SE) upon program
                  comprehension. We applied a crossover design on
                  different tests involving fragments of C code that
                  include increment and decrement operators. Each test
                  had an SE version and a side-effect-free
                  counterpart. The variables measured in the
                  treatments were the number of correct answers and
                  the time spent in answering. The results show that
                  the side-effect operators considered significantly
                  reduce performance in comprehension-related tasks,

@Article{ernst:2001:tse,
  Abstract =	 {Explicitly stated program invariants can help
                  programmers by identifying program properties that
                  must be preserved when modifying code.  In practice,
                  however, these invariants are usually implicit.  An
                  alternative to expecting programmers to fully
                  annotate code with invariants is to automatically
                  infer likely invariants from the program itself.
                  This research focuses on dynamic techniques for
                  discovering invariants from execution traces.  \par
                  This article reports three results.  First, it
                  describes techniques for dynamically discovering
                  invariants, along with an implementation, named
                  Daikon, that embodies these techniques.  Second, it
                  reports on the application of Daikon to two sets of
                  target programs.  In programs from Gries's work on
                  program derivation, the system rediscovered
                  predefined invariants.  In a C program lacking
                  explicit invariants, the system discovered
                  invariants that assisted a software evolution task.
                  These experiments demonstrate that, at least for
                  small programs, invariant inference is both accurate
                  and useful.  Third, it analyzes scalability issues
                  such as invariant detection runtime and accuracy as
                  functions of test suites and program points
                  instrumented.},

  Abstract =	 {Component-based technology is increasingly adopted
                  to speed up the development of complex software
                  through component reuse.  Unfortunately, the lack of
                  complete information about reused components, and
                  the complex interaction patterns among components
                  can lead to subtle problems that throw new
                  verification challenges.  Good components are often
                  re-used many times, sometimes within product lines,
                  in other cases across different products. The reuse
                  of components provides a lot of information that
                  could be useful for verification.  In this paper, we
                  show how to automatically analyze component
                  interactions by collecting information about
                  components' behavior during testing and field
                  execution, and then using the collected information
                  for checking the compatibility of components when
                  updated or reused in new products.  The paper
                  illustrates the main problems in developing the
                  idea, proposes original solutions, and presents a
                  preliminary experience that illustrates the
                  effectiveness of the approach.},

  Abstract =	 {A location is said to be immutable if its value and
                  the values of selected locations reachable from it
                  are guaranteed to remain unchanged during a
                  specified time interval. We introduce a framework
                  for immutability specification, and discuss its
                  application to code optimization. Compared to a
                  final declaration, an immutability assertion in our
                  framework can express a richer set of immutability
                  properties along three dimensions --- lifetime,
                  reachability and context. We present a framework for
                  processing and verifying immutability annotations in
                  Java, as well as extending optimizations so as to
                  exploit immutability information. Preliminary
                  experimental results show that a significant number
                  (82\%) of read accesses could potentially be
                  classified as immutable in our framework. Further,
                  use of immutability information yields substantial
                  reductions (33\% to 99\%) in the number of dynamic
                  read accesses, and also measurable speedups in the
                  range of 5\% to 10\% for certain benchmark
                  programs.},

  Abstract =	 {We present a new purity and side effect analysis for
                  Java programs. A method is pure if it does not
                  mutate any location that exists in the program state
                  right before the invocation of the method.  Our
                  analysis is built on top of a combined pointer and
                  escape analysis, and is able to determine that
                  methods are pure even when the methods mutate the
                  heap, provided they mutate only new objects.  Our
                  analysis provides useful information even for impure
                  methods. In particular, it can recognize read-only
                  parameters (a parameter is read-only if the method
                  does not mutate any objects transitively reachable
                  from the parameter) and safe parameters (a parameter
                  is safe if it is read-only and the method does not
                  create any new externally visible heap paths to
                  objects transitively reachable from the
                  parameter). The analysis can also generate regular
                  expressions that characterize the externally visible
                  heap locations that the method mutates.  We have
                  implemented our analysis and used it to analyze
                  several applications. Our results show that our
                  analysis effectively recognizes a variety of pure
                  methods, including pure methods that allocate and
                  mutate complex auxiliary data structures.},

@article{Rompf:2012:LMS,
  Abstract =	 {Good software engineering practice demands
                  generalization and abstraction, whereas high
                  performance demands specialization and
                  concretization.  These goals are at odds, and
                  compilers can only rarely translate expressive
                  high-level programs to modern hardware platforms in
                  a way that makes best use of the available
                  resources. Generative programming is a promising
                  alternative to fully automatic translation.  Instead
                  of writing down the target program directly,
                  developers write a program generator, which produces
                  the target program as its output. The generator can
                  be written in a high-level, generic style and can
                  still produce efficient, specialized target
                  programs. In practice, however, developing
                  high-quality program generators requires a very
                  large effort that is often hard to amortize. We
                  present lightweight modular staging (LMS), a
                  generative programming approach that lowers this
                  effort significantly. LMS seamlessly combines
                  program generator logic with the generated code in a
                  single program, using only types to distinguish the
                  two stages of execution. Through extensive use of
                  component technology, LMS makes a reusable and
                  extensible compiler framework available at the
                  library level, allowing programmers to tightly
                  integrate domain-specific abstractions and
                  optimizations into the generation process, with
                  common generic optimizations provided by the
                  framework. LMS is well suited to develop embedded
                  domain-specific languages (DSLs) and has been used
                  to develop powerful performance-oriented DSLs for
                  demanding domains such as machine learning, with
                  code generation for heterogeneous platforms
                  including GPUs. LMS has also been used to generate
                  SQL for embedded database queries and JavaScript for
                  web applications.},

  Abstract =	 {This paper gives an overview of the implementation
                  of NESL, a portable nested data-parallel
                  language. This language and its implementation are
                  the first to fully support nested data structures as
                  well as nested data-parallel function calls. These
                  features allow the concise description of parallel
                  algorithms on irregular data, such as sparse
                  matrices and graphs. In addition, they maintain the
                  advantages of data-parallel languages: a simple
                  programming model and portability.  The current NESL
                  implementation is based on an intermediate language
                  called VCODE and a library of vectore routines
                  called CVL. It runs on the Connection Machine CM-2,
                  the Cray Y-MP C90, and serial machines.  We compare
                  initial benchmark results of NESL with those of
                  machine-specific code on these machines for three
                  algorithms: least-squares line-fitting, median
                  finding, and a sparse-matrix vector product. These
                  results show that NESL's performance is competitive
                  with that of machine-specific codes for regular
                  dense data, and is often superior for irregular
                  data.},

  Abstract =	 {Abstract As large-scale, detailed network modeling
                  projects are flourishing in the field of
                  computational neuroscience, it is more and more
                  important to design single neuron models that not
                  only capture qualitative features of real neurons
                  but are quantitatively accurate in silico
                  representations of those. Recent years have seen
                  substantial effort being put in the development of
                  algorithms for the systematic evaluation and
                  optimization of neuron models with respect to
                  electrophysiological data. It is however difficult
                  to compare these methods because of the lack of
                  appropriate benchmark tests. Here, we describe one
                  such effort of providing the community with a
                  standardized set of tests to quantify the
                  performances of single neuron models. Our effort
                  takes the form of a yearly challenge similar to the
                  ones which have been present in the machine learning
                  community for some time. This paper gives an account
                  of the first two challenges which took place in 2007
                  and 2008 and discusses future directions. The
                  results of the competition suggest that best
                  performance on data obtained from single or double
                  electrode current or conductance injection is
                  achieved by models that combine features of standard
                  leaky integrate-and-fire models with a second
                  variable reflecting adaptation, refractoriness, or a
                  dynamic threshold.},

  Abstract =	 {Class names represent the concepts implemented in
                  object-oriented source code and are key elements in
                  program comprehension and, thus, software
                  maintenance. Programming conventions often state
                  that class names should be noun-phrases, but there
                  is little further guidance for developers on the
                  composition of class names. Other researchers have
                  observed that the majority of Java class identifier
                  names are composed of one or more nouns preceded,
                  optionally, by one or more adjectives. However, no
                  detailed analysis of class identifier name structure
                  has been undertaken that could be leveraged to
                  support program comprehension activities.  We
                  investigate the lexical and syntactic composition of
                  Java class identifier names in two ways. Firstly, as
                  others have done for C function and Java method
                  names, we identify conventional patterns found in
                  the use of parts of speech. Secondly, we identify
                  the origin of words used in class names within the
                  name of any super class and implemented interfaces
                  to identify patterns of class name construction
                  related to inheritance.  Through the analysis of
                  120,000 unique class names found in 60 open source
                  projects we identify both common and project
                  specific class naming conventions. We apply this
                  knowledge in a case study of the mind-mapping tool
                  Freemind to investigate whether class names that
                  follow unconventional naming schemes are candidates
                  for refactoring ? either a name refactoring that
                  conforms to established naming conventions within
                  the code base, or refactoring of the class that
                  results in conventionally named classes.},

	Abstract = {Object-oriented frameworks are often difficult to use. Framework- specific extensions to integrated development environments (IDEs) aim to mitigate the difficulty by offering tools that leverage the knowledge about framework{\textquoteright}s application programming interfaces (APIs). These tools commonly offer support for code visualization, automatic and interactive code generation, and code validation. Current practices, however, require such extensions to be custom-built manually for each supported framework. In this paper, we propose an approach to building framework-specific IDE extensions based on framework-specific modeling languages (FSMLs). We show how the definitions of different FSMLs can be interpreted in these extensions to provide advanced tool support for different framework APIs that the FSMLs are designed for.},

  Abstract =	 {Recent advances in programming environments have
                  focused on improving programmer productivity by
                  utilizing the inherent structure in computer
                  programs.  However, because these environments
                  represent code as plain text, it is difficult and
                  sometimes impossible to embed interactive tools,
                  annotations, and alternative views in the code
                  itself. Barista is an implementation framework that
                  enables the creation of such user interfaces by
                  simplifying the implementation of editors that
                  represent code internally as an abstract syntax tree

  Abstract =	 {Calcite is a new Eclipse plugin that helps address
                  the difficulty of understanding and correctly using
                  an {API.} Calcite finds the most popular ways to
                  instantiate a given class or interface by using code
                  examples. To allow the users to easily add these
                  object instantiations to their code, Calcite adds
                  items to the popup completion menu that will insert
                  the appropriate code into the user's
                  program. Calcite also uses crowd sourcing to add to
                  the menu instructions in the form of comments that
                  help the user perform functions that people have
                  identified as missing from the {API.} In a user
                  study, Calcite improved users' success rate by
                  40\%.},

                  its usage. Usage data from 41 developers using Java
                  and Eclipse shows that they're using advanced
                  features such as refactoring and are extending the
                  environment using third-party tools. However, they
                  rarely use some of the other features, such as
                  bookmarking places in the code. The article also

  Abstract =	 {Code completion is a widely used productivity
                  tool. It takes away the burden of remembering and
                  typing the exact names of methods or classes: As a
                  developer starts typing a name, it provides a
                  progressively refined list of candidates matching
                  the name. However, the candidate list always comes
                  in alphabetic order, i.e., the environment is only
                  second-guessing the name based on pattern
                  matching. Finding the correct candidate can be
                  cumbersome or slower than typing the full name. We
                  present an approach to improve code completion with
                  program history. We define a benchmark measuring the
                  accuracy and usefulness of a code completion
                  engine. Further, we use the change history data to
                  also improve the results offered by code completion
                  tools. Finally, we propose an alternative interface
                  for completion tools.},

  Abstract =	 {The suggestions made by current {IDE's} code
                  completion features are based exclusively on static
                  type system of the programming language. As a
                  result, often proposals are made which are
                  irrelevant for a particular working context. Also,
                  these suggestions are ordered alphabetically rather
                  than by their relevance in a particular context. In
                  this paper, we present intelligent code completion
                  systems that learn from existing code
                  repositories. We have implemented three such
                  systems, each using the information contained in
                  repositories in a different way. We perform a
                  large-scale quantitative evaluation of these
                  systems, integrate the best performing one into
                  Eclipse, and evaluate the latter also by a user
                  study. Our experiments give evidence that
                  intelligent code completion systems which learn from
                  examples significantly outperform mainstream code
                  completion systems in terms of the relevance of
                  their suggestions and thus have the potential to
                  enhance developers' productivity.},

  Abstract =	 {The widespread deployment of recommender systems has
                  lead to user feedback of varying quality. While some
                  users faithfully express their true opinion, many
                  provide noisy ratings which can be detrimental to
                  the quality of the generated recommendations. The
                  presence of noise can violate modeling assumptions
                  and may thus lead to instabilities in estimation and
                  prediction. Even worse, malicious users can
                  deliberately insert attack profiles in an attempt to
                  bias the recommender system to their benefit. Robust
                  statistics is an area within statistics where
                  estimation methods have been developed that
                  deteriorate more gracefully in the presence of
                  unmodeled noise and slight departures from modeling
                  assumptions. In this work, we study how such robust
                  statistical methods, in particular M-estimators, can
                  be used to generate stable recommendation even in
                  the presence of noise and spam. To that extent, we
                  present a Robust Matrix Factorization algorithm and
                  study its stability. We conclude that M-estimators
                  do not add significant stability to recommendation;
                  however the presented algorithm can outperform
                  existing recommendation algorithms in its
                  recommendation quality.},

                  comparing the usability of the factory pattern and
                  constructors in {API} designs found highly
                  significant results indicating that factories are
                  detrimental to {API} usability in several varied
                  situations. The results showed that users require
                  significantly more time (p = 0.005) to construct an
                  object with a factory than with a constructor while
                  performing both context-sensitive and context- free
                  tasks. These results suggest that the use of
                  factories can and should be avoided in many cases
                  where other techniques, such as constructors or
                  class clusters, can be used instead.},

  Abstract =	 {The popularity of {XML} has motivated the
                  development of novel {XML} processing tools many of
                  which embed the {XPath} language for {XML} querying,
                  transformation, constraint specification,
                  etc. {XPath} developers (as well as less technical
                  users) have access to commercial tools to help them
                  use the language effectively. Example tools include
                  debuggers that return the result of {XPath}
                  subexpressions visualized in the context of the
                  input {XML} {document.This} paper provides a glimpse
                  of the functionality of {XPlainer-Eclipse,} a novel
                  kind of query understanding and debugging tool that
                  provides visual explanations of why {XPath}
                  expressions return a specific
                  answer. {XPlainer-Eclipse} combines editors for
                  visualizing both {XML} documents and {XPath}
                  expressions as trees together with the explanation
                  of the answers.},

	Abstract = {Over the past decade, I have performed several field
		 studies with scientists developing software either on
		 their own or together with software engineers. Based on
		 these field study data, I identify a model of
		 scientific software development as practiced in many
		 scientific laboratories and communities. This model
		 does not fit the standard software engineering models.
		 For example, the tasks of requirement elicitation and
		 software evaluation are not clearly delineated.
		 Nevertheless, it appears to be successful within the
		 context in which it is used. In the context in which
		 scientists collaborate with software engineers,
		 however, I describe problems which arose from the clash
		 of this model with a traditional,phased software
		 engineering model. Given these models, I discuss the
		 issues which have to be addressed in order to determine
		 the software techniques and tools which might best
		 support scientific software development in different
		 contexts.},

  Abstract =	 {This paper reports on the development and formal
                  verification (proof of semantic preservation) of
                  CompCert, a compiler from Clight (a large subset of
                  the C programming language) to PowerPC assembly
                  code, using the Coq proof assistant both for
                  programming the compiler and for proving its
                  correctness.  Such a verified compiler is useful in
                  the context of critical software and its formal
                  verification: the verification of the compiler
                  guarantees that the safety properties proved on the
                  source code hold for the executable compiled code as
                  well.},
